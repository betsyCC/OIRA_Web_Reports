      <description>In the first blog post, How this site was created…, I very briefly described the tools I used to create this draft website. Since then a lot of additional customizations have been made to get the draft to a more finished working state. I wanted to document the basic steps taken and files that needed to be changed in order to customize the tools used to create this site before I forget so that others who are interested in doing something similar or who want to use this draft and make further customizations to suit their own needs will have a starting point to work from.</description>

      <description>This is my first blog post which I created mostly to test out how the blog would work if we decided to have one.
This website is a draft for testing out options for posting accessible data tables and reports for CUNY’s Office of Institutional Research.
This site was created using RStudio and blogdown using the default blogdown/Hugo theme, hugo-lithium, as a base and then customizing it to be more in line with CUNY’s branding by altering the layouts and CSS.</description>
